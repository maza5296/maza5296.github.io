1.1 The DOM inspector presents the HTML objects nested within their relative parents. This allows you to find the object within an HTML with relative ease without scanning through the whole HTML code.

1.2 JavaScript powered D3 is enabling the data to be generated into HTML format which the browser understands. The original data is stored as JSON (Javascript Object Notation).

2.1 You could, but ideally not. If you are filtering for country, it is not ideal to have 119 checkboxes. A dropdown may work well. If you are adding a range for GDP, then again, a dropdown could work well.

3.1 You could aggregate by year. This would give you for example the total population of the world in that year. A dropdown would be good because you don't want too many checkboxes showing on the page.

4.1 It is an array of objects. The objects hold the data for the gdp, population, and exports for the country during each respective year.

5.1 SVG can be dynamically manipulated using javascript and css. HTML is static and while it can render shapes and pixels, it does not accomplish much more. SVG is more suited to vizualization because it allows for the audience to interact with the data.

7.1 Visualization is used to communicate data in a form that is more understandable to humans. For example, visualization can be used to map the location of HTTP requests in the world, and identify where they are headed. This will allow humans to understand not only the quantity of the requests, but to compare them accross region and discover the meaning behind the data.

7.2 By making a chart more interactive, you enable the human to be able to compare the chart accross different elements. For example, by filtering for continent, you can compare the how each country does relative to another. By filtering for year, you can see how countries compare to their past, and how they have developed.

7.3 Limits of visualization are defined by the available computational capacity, human perceptual and cognitive capacity, and display capacity.

7.4 Data by itself cannot be interpreted meaningfully without human intervention. A semantic data model takes into consideration the real life relationships and connections between the data.

7.5 a) Quantitative and c) Ordinal

7.6 Shape, color, size

7.7 Position, length, angle
