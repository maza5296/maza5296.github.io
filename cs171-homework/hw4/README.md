# Dear CS171 Team
Our group misread the instructions and uploaded the proposal to our [group github repository](https://github.com/nhunhu9/cs171-pr-flightdata).
We then re-uploaded the proposal in our individual repositories. One of us has a dance performance today (Saturday April 4th and so may not be able to reupload). We hope that she does not get penalized for this. Apologies for the confusion. Thank you for your understanding.


# Homework 4 - Final Project Proposal 
*This homework is due on Friday, April 3rd 2015, 11:59 pm*

This homework consists of your final project proposal. You can find details about the project proposal on the [CS 171 website](http://www.cs171.org/2015/project/). Your proposal consists of two parts:

1. The project data form that can be [filled out here](http://goo.gl/forms/7mUvvOTtW2).
- The proposal document ([see guidelines](http://www.cs171.org/2015/project/#proposal))

You may only fill out the project data form **once per team**. You must submit your (identical) proposal document **once per person**. Put the project proposal in a file *proposal_lastname1_lastname2_lastname3.pdf* in your git repository. We will judge the proposal document based on its content and document quality, so please use full sentences, correct grammar and include Figures and captions for clarifications.
