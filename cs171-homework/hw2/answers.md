**Question 0.1:** The horizontal and vertical positions of the node represent the position on the SVG that the node will be appended to, with the top left coordinate being (0,0). A dataset with two or more variables to compare, and multiple inputs would be suitable. 

**Question 0.2:** Angle, curvature, shape, motion, texture.

**Question 0.3:** Some of them are dependent, such as shape and curvature. Texture and shape are independent.

**Question 1.1:** Relative position will show us the relation between two countries (i.e which has higher population), but due to clustering, can become unclear if countries have similar values. Absolute position can only communicate the names of the countries, but can display this clearly.

**Question 1.2:** Ordered data is usually good. Quantitive is good because all points will have meaning in relation to another (e.g. SAT scores vs GPA). Ordinal can sometimes be used (e.g. T shirt size and sale with sizes categorized in rows on the x axis).

**Question 2.1:** D3 layout can be dynamically manipulated even if the dataset changes. It can also be responsive to the user if when the click on any element of the chart.
